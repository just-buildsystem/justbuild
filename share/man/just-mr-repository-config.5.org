#+TITLE: JUST-MR REPOSITORY CONFIG
#+MAN_CLASS_OPTIONS: section-id=5

* NAME

just-mr repository config 
-- The format of the repository config used by *just-mr(1)*

* DESCRIPTION

In order for the *just-mr(1)* tool to generate a repository 
configuration file usable by the *just(1)* multi-repository build system,
it requires a configuration file describing repositories 
and their dependencies.

The file is read as JSON. Any other serialization describing 
the same JSON object is equivalent. It is assumed that in JSON
objects keys occur at most once; it is implementation defined
how repetitions of the same key are treated.

** Workspace root description

A repository's /workspace root description/ provides information about
the location of source files. It can be an explicit description,
given as a JSON object, or an implicit one, given as the global name 
of another repository, from which the workspace root can be inferred. 

Explicit workspace roots can be of several types, distinguishable 
by the value of the key ~"type"~ in the JSON object.
Depending on this value, other fields in the object are also supported.

*** ~"file"~

It defines as workspace root a directory on the file system.

The following fields are supported:

- ~"path"~ provides the root directory containing the source files.
  This entry is mandatory.

*** ~"archive"~ / ~"zip"~

They define as workspace root a remote archive.
The only difference between the two types is the nature of the archive: 
a compressed tarball in the case of ~"archive"~,
or a compressed zip file in the case of ~"zip"~.

The following fields are supported:

- ~"content"~ provides the git blob hash of the archive file. 
  This has to be specified in hex encoding. This entry is mandatory.

- ~"fetch"~ specifies the URL to the remote archive.
  This entry is mandatory.

- ~"distfile"~ provides an alternative name for the archive file. 
  This entry is optional. If missing, it is implied from the fetch URL.

- ~"sha256"~, 
- ~"sha512"~ provide optional checksum hashes in order to verify 
  the integrity of the remote site archive.
  These have to be provided in hex encoding.
  These checks are only performed if the archive file is actually downloaded
  from the (potentially untrusted) network and not already available locally.

- ~"subdir"~ specifies the subdirectory withing the unpacked archive.
  If missing, the root directory of the archive is used.

*** ~"git"~

It defines as workspace root a part of a Git repository.

The following fields are supported:

- ~"repository"~ provides the URL of the Git repository.
  This entry is mandatory.

- ~"commit"~ contains the commit hash. 
  This has to be specified in hex encoding. This entry is mandatory.

- ~"branch"~ provides the branch name, with the promise that it
  contains the aforementioned commit. This entry is mandatory.

- ~"subdir"~ specifies the subdirectory containing the distribution files.
  If missing, the root directory of the Git repository is used.

*** ~"distdir"~

It defines as workspace root a directory with the distribution archives 
of the specified repositories. Usually this root is realized as a Git tree
in the Git repository in ~just~'s local build root.

The following fields are supported:

- ~"repositories"~ provides a list of global names of repositories.
  This entry is mandatory.

*** Additional keys

The key ~"pragma"~ is reserved for type-specific repository
directives which alter the workspace root. It is given as a JSON object.
The different workspace roots might support different keys for this object; 
unsupported keys are always ignored.

For a ~"file"~ workspace root, the pragma key ~"to_git"~ is supported.
If its value is ~"true"~, it indicates that the workspace root should be 
returned as a Git tree. If the root directory is already part of a Git repository,
its Git tree identifier is used; otherwise, the workspace root will be realized
as a Git tree in the Git repository in ~just~'s local build root.

** Repository description

A /repository description/ is defined as a JSON object, 
containing a /workspace root description/, directory roots and names
for targets, rules, and expressions files, 
and bindings to other repositories. 

Specifically, the following fields are supported:

- ~"repository"~ contains a /workspace root description/. 
  This entry is mandatory.

- ~"target_root"~,
- ~"rule_root"~,
- ~"expression_root"~ define the root directories for the targets, 
  rules, and expressions, respectively.
  If provided, they are passed on expanded to the workspace root
  of the repository named by their value.

- ~"target_file_name"~,
- ~"rule_file_name"~,
- ~"expression_file_name"~ refer to the name of the files containing
  the targets, rules, and expressions, respectively, 
  located relative to the corresponding root directories.
  These entries are optional. If provided, they are passed on as-is.

- ~"bindings"~ provides a JSON object defining dependencies on other
  repositories. The object's keys are strings defining local repository names, 
  while the values are the corresponding global names of those repositories.
  If provided, this entry is passed on as-is.

** Repository configuration format

The repository configuration format is structured as a JSON 
object. The following fields are supported:

- ~"main"~ contains a JSON string that determines which of the provided
  repositories is considered the main repository.

- ~"repositories"~ contains a JSON object, where each key is the 
  global name of a repository and its corresponding value is the
  /repository description/.

** Additional keys

Any JSON object described in this format might have additional keys
besides the ones mentioned.
The current strategy of *just-mr(1)* is to accept and ignore them.
Users should be aware that future versions of this format might give
specific meanings to these extra keys.
