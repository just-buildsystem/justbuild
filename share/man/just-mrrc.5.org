* NAME

just-mr configuration -- The format of the configuration used by *just-mr(1)*

* DESCRIPTION

The file is read as JSON. Any other serialization describing the
same JSON object is equivalent. We assume, that in JSON objects,
each key occurs at most once; it is implementation defined how
repetitions of the same key are treated.

** Location objects

A /location/ is a JSON object with the keys ~"root"~, ~"path"~, and ~"base"~.

The value for key ~"root"~ is either ~"workspace"~, ~"home"~, or ~"system"~,
which have the following meanings:

- ~"workspace"~ refers to the root of the workspace in which the ~just-mr~
  invocation was issued (not the workspace of the requested main repository).
  This location root is ignored if ~just-mr~ was not invoked from inside a
  workspace.

- ~"home"~ refers to the user's home directory.

- ~"system"~ refers to the system root ~/~.

The value for key ~"path"~ is the relative path of the item to locate within
the location root.

The value for key ~"base"~ is a relative path within the location root. This
path is only relevant for locations of config files. If such a config file
contains relative paths, those will be resolved relative to the specified base.
If omitted, the default value ~.~ is used.

** The just-mrrc format

The just-mrrc is given by a JSON object.

- The value for the key ~"config lookup order"~ is a JSON list of location
  objects, specifying where to look for multi-repository configurations (see
  *just-mr-repository-config(5)* for more detail). The lookup is performed in
  the same order the location objects appear in the list.

- The value for the key ~"local build root"~ is a single location object,
  specifying the path to use as the local build root. For more details, see
  *just-mr(1)*.

- The value for the key ~"checkout locations"~ is a single location object,
  specifying the path to the file for checkout locations. For more details, see
  *just-mr(1)*.

- The value for the key ~"distdirs"~ is a JSON list of location objects,
  specifying where to look for distribution files (usually collected via the
  subcommand ~fetch~). The lookup is performed in the same order the location
  objects appear in the list. For more details, see *just-mr(1)*.

- The value for the key ~"just"~ is a single location object, specifying the
  path to the ~just~ binary to use for execution, if ~just-mr~ is used as a
  launcher.

- The value for the key ~"git"~ is a single location object, specifying the
  path to the git binary to use in the instances when ~just-mr~ needs to shell
  out.

- The value for the key ~"local launcher"~, if given, is list of
  strings setting the default for local launcher for ~just-mr~;
  command-line arguments take precedence over the value in the
  configuration file. If the key ~"local launcher"~ is absent, the
  default ~["env", "--"]~ is assumed.

- The value for the key ~"log limit"~, if given, sets the default
  value for the log limit, that can be overridden by the command-line
  options.

- The value ~"log files"~, if given, has to be a list of location
  objects, specifying additional log files, on top of those specified
  on the command line.

- The value for the key ~"just args"~ is a JSON object. Its keys are ~just~
  subcommands and its value is a JSON list of strings. For the corresponding
  subcommand, these strings are prefixed to the ~just~ argument vector, if
  ~just-mr~ is used as a launcher.

* EXAMPLE

An example just-mrrc file could look like the following:
