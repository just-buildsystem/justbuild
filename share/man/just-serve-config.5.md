% JUST SERVE CONFIG(5) | File Formats Manual

NAME
====

just-serve-config - The format of the configuration used by the **`serve`**
subcommand of **`just`**(1)

DESCRIPTION
===========

The file is read as JSON. Any other serialization describing the same
JSON object is equivalent. We assume, that in JSON objects, each key
occurs at most once; it is implementation defined how repetitions of the
same key are treated.

Location objects
----------------

The general syntax and semantics of a location object are described in 
**`just-mrrc`**(5). Here we use a restricted form where the value for key
*`"root"`* can only be either *`"home"`* or *`"system"`*. This is because
`just serve` is not aware of the concept of workspaces.

The just-serve configuration format
-----------------------------------

The configuration file is given by a JSON object.

 - The value for the key *`"local build root"`* is a single location object,
   specifying the path to use as the root for local CAS, cache, and build
   directories. The path will be created if it does not exist already.

 - The value for the key *`"repositories"`* is a list of location objects,
   specifying paths to Git repositories for **`just`** **`serve`** to use as
   additional object lookup locations. The paths are to be used in the order
   given and only if requested objects are not found in the local build root.

 - The value for the key *`"logging"`* is a JSON object specifying logging
   options.  
   For subkey *`"files"`* the value is a list of location objects, specifying
   one or more local log files to use.  
   For subkey *`"limit"`* the value is an integer setting the default for
   the log limit.  
   For subkey *`"restrict stderr limit"`* the value is an integer setting a
   restriction for the log on stderr.  
   For subkey *`"plain"`* the value is a flag. If set, do not use ANSI escape
   sequences to highlight messages.  
   For subkey *`"append"`* the value is a flag. If set, append messages to log
   file instead of overwriting existing.

  - The value for the key *`"authentication"`* is a JSON object specifying
   client-side authentication options for **`just`** **`serve`** when
   communicating with the remote execution endpoint.  
   For subkey *`"ca cert"`* the value is a single location object, specifying
   the path to a TLS CA certificate.  
   For subkey *`"client cert"`* the value is a single location object,
   specifying the path to a TLS client certificate.  
   For subkey *`"client key"`* the value is a single location object,
   specifying the path to a TLS client key.  

 - The value for the key *`"remote service"`* is a JSON object specifying the
   server arguments for running **`just`** **`serve`** as a service.  
   For subkey *`"interface"`* the value specifies the interface of the service.
   If unset, the loopback device is used.  
   For subkey *`"port"`* the value specifies the port to which the service is to
   listen. If unset, the service will choose to the first available one.  
   For subkey *`"pid file"`* the value is a single location object, specifying
   the path to a file to which the pid should be stored in plain text. If the
   file exists, it will be overwritten.  
   For subkey *`"info file"`* the value specifies a single location object,
   specifying the path to a file file to which the used port, interface, and
   pid should be stored in JSON format. If the file exists, it will be
   overwritten.  
   For subkey *`"server cert"`* the value is a single location object,
   specifying the path to a TLS server certificate.  
   For subkey *`"server key"`* the value is a single location object,
   specifying the path to a TLS server key.  

 - The value for the key *`"execution endpoint"`* is a JSON object specifying
   the arguments of a remote execution endpoint to be used by **`just`**
   **`serve`**.  
   For subkey *`"address"`* the value is a string specifying the remote
   execution address in a NAME:PORT format.  
   For subkey *`"compatible"`* the value is a flag which specifies whether
   the remote endpoint uses the original remote execution protocol.  
   If the key *`"execution endpoint"`* is given, the following three keys will
   be evaluated as well:  
   - *`"max-attempts"`*: the value must be a number specifying the maximum
     number of attempts to perform when a remote procedure call (to the
     *`"execution endpoint"`* given) fails because the resource is unavailable.  
   - *`"initial-backoff-seconds"`*: the value must be a number; before retrying
     the second time, the client will wait the given amount of seconds plus a jitter,
     to better distribute the workload.  
   - *`"max-backoff-seconds"`*: the value must be a number; from the third
     attempt (included) on, the backoff time is doubled at each attempt, until
     it exceeds the `"max-backoff-seconds"` value. From that point, the waiting
     time is computed as `"max-backoff-seconds"` value plus a jitter.  

 - The value for the key *`"jobs"`* specifies the number of jobs to run. If
   unset, the number of available cores is used.  

 - The value for the key *`"build"`* is a JSON object specifying arguments used
   by **`just`** **`serve`** to orchestrate remote builds.  
   For subkey *`"build jobs"`* the value specifies the number of jobs to run
   during a remote build. If unset, the same value as for outer key *`"jobs"`*
   is used.  
   For subkey *`"action timeout"`* the value in a number specifying the timeout
   limit in seconds for actions run during a remote build. If unset, the default
   value 300 is used.  
   For subkey *`"target-cache write strategy"`* the value has to
   be one of the values *`"disable"`*, *`"sync"`*, or *`"split"`*.
   The default is *`"sync"`*, giving the instruction to
   synchronize artifacts and write target-level cache entries.
   The value *`"split"`* does the same using blob splitting
   when synchronizing artifacts, provided it is supported by the
   remote-execution endpoint. The value *`"disable"`* disables
   adding new entries to the target-level cache, which defeats the
   purpose of typical set up to share target-level computations
   between clients.  
   For the subkey *`"local launcher"`*, if given, the value has
   to be a list. This list is used as local launcher for the
   build in the case the serve process acts simultaneously as
   remote-execution endpoint. If unset (or `null`), the value
   `["env", "--"]` will be taken as default.

EXAMPLE
=======

An example serve configuration file could look as follows.

```jsonc
{ "local build root": {"root": "system", "path": "var/just-serve/root"}
, "authentication":
  { "ca cert":
    {"root": "system", "path": "etc/just-serve/certs/ca.crt"}
  , "client cert":
    {"root": "system", "path": "etc/just-serve/certs/client.crt"}
  , "client key":
    {"root": "system", "path": "etc/just-serve/certs/client.key"}
  }
, "remote service":
  { "interface": "192.0.2.1"
  , "port": 9999
  , "pid file":
    {"root": "system", "path": "var/run/just-serve/server.pid"}
  , "server cert":
    {"root": "system", "path": "etc/just-serve/certs/server.crt"}
  , "server key":
    {"root": "system", "path": "etc/just-serve/certs/server.key"}
  }
, "execution endpoint": {"address": "198.51.100.1:8989"}
, "repositories":
  [ {"root": "system", "path": "var/just-serve/repos/third-party-distfiles"}
  , {"root": "system", "path": "var/just-serve/repos/project-foo"}
  , {"root": "system", "path": "var/just-serve/repos/project-bar"}
  ]
, "logging":
  {"files": [{"root": "home", "path": ".log/just-serve/latest"}]}
, "jobs": 8
, "build": {"build jobs": 128}
, "max-attempts": 10
, "initial-backoff-seconds": 10
, "max-backoff-seconds": 60
}
```
